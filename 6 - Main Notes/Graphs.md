# Graphs

Graphs mainly consists of two components - vertice and edge. Where E < V^2
Where it can be mainly represented in three formats
1.Matrix
2.Adjacency Matrix
3.Adjacency List

## Matrix

Matrix method is where the matrix is shown as grid with 0s to represent free space and 1s to represent blocked space. We can traverse throughs 0s.

## Adjacency Matrix

Adjacency Matrix is another way to represent a graph, It is a square matrix of N x N size where N is the number of nodes in the graph and it is used to represent the connections between the vertices of a graph.

It is very space heavy so the use of a Adjacency matrix is discouraged.

### Adjacency Matrix DFS

```python
